### My Mission

I strive to understand and provide customers with the information they need to make better, more sustainable decisions and help businesses focus on systems and processes that will streamline their business through thoughtful research, design, and business strategy.

### I’ve developed & managed processes, products, and people

- Created and led cross-functional teams
- Managed a service as a product
- Created and drove internal adoption of new processes and systems
- Led projects with Fortune 500 clients from the initial sale to the final deliverable

In each of these projects, I have made clients hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars in additional revenue through A/B testing, research, and design changes and adoption.

### My Superpowers

- I have mastered the art (science?) of getting people who disagree to come together and work toward a common goal.
- I’m a master of identifying how to spot the highest-impact problems and solutions to get my clients great results.

### I love writing about what I’ve learned

I write about projects, process, and skills that I’ve gained over the years in an effort to help teach others. [See my writing here.](/articles)
